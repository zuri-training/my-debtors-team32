                    Debt Monitoring agency (DMA) is a platform that allows
                    school owners manage debt crisis by checkmating the student
                    debtors, and centrally co-ordinate debt management, its a
                    debt management and collections system that eliminates
                    manual effort, reduces errors, and improves your ability to
                    collect unpaid debts, such that school owners minimize the
                    risk of admitting wards previously owing in their former
                    schools, and want to ward off payment, with DMA, school
                    managers increase their chances of admitting credit worthy
                    wards, whose guardians take complete responsibility for
                    their tuition.
